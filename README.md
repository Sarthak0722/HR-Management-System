### API Documentation
Each service provides Swagger documentation:
- Auth Service: http://localhost:3001/docs
- HR Service: http://localhost:3002/docs
- Employee Service: http://localhost:3003/docs
- RAG Service: http://localhost:3004/docs

## üîê Authentication

### Demo Credentials
- **HR User**: hr@company.com / hr123456
- **Employee User**: employee@company.com / emp123456

### JWT Token
- Stored in HTTP-only cookies
- 7-day expiration
- Role-based access control
- Automatic refresh handling

## ü§ñ AI Features

### RAG Pipeline
1. **Embedding Generation**: HR policies are embedded using sentence transformers
2. **Vector Storage**: Embeddings stored in-memory with metadata
3. **Semantic Search**: User queries are embedded and matched against policy embeddings
4. **LLM Generation**: Relevant policies are sent to Groq LLM for answer generation
5. **Source Attribution**: Answers include confidence scores and source policies

### HR Policies Dataset
The system includes 10 comprehensive HR policies covering:
- Leave management
- Work hours and attendance
- Code of conduct
- Performance management
- Benefits and compensation
- IT and security
- Dress code
- Training and development
- Termination and resignation
- Health and safety

## üìä Database Schema

### Core Entities
- **User**: Authentication and role management
- **EmployeeProfile**: Employee personal and professional information
- **Leave**: Leave requests with approval workflow

### Relationships
- User 1:1 EmployeeProfile
- User 1:N Leave (employee can have multiple leave requests)
- Leave N:1 User (approved by HR user)

## üê≥ Docker Configuration

### Services
- **postgres**: PostgreSQL 15 with persistent volume
- **auth-service**: Port 3001
- **hr-service**: Port 3002
- **employee-service**: Port 3003
- **rag-service**: Port 3004
- **frontend**: Port 3000

### Networking
All services communicate through a custom Docker network (`hrms-network`) with service discovery.

## üîç Monitoring & Logging

### Logging
- **Winston** for structured logging
- **Morgan** for HTTP request logging
- Log files: `logs/combined.log`, `logs/error.log`
- Console output in development

### Health Checks
Each service provides health endpoints:
- `/health` - Basic health status
- Service-specific health checks for dependencies

## üß™ Testing

### API Testing
Use the Swagger documentation or tools like Postman/Insomnia to test API endpoints.

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm test
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Considerations
1. **Environment Variables**: Update all secrets and URLs
2. **Database**: Use managed PostgreSQL service
3. **Security**: Enable HTTPS, update CORS settings
4. **Monitoring**: Add application monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
5. **Scaling**: Consider horizontal scaling for high-traffic scenarios

### Docker Production
```bash
# Build production images
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build

# Deploy
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```
